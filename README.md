## Introduction
I'm Priyam Gautam, a recent B.Tech graduate with a background in Computer Science, having graduated in 2022. I am currently a Frontend Developer with 6 months of professional experience and an additional 4 months of internship experience in the field.

My passion for creating engaging and user-friendly web interfaces has driven my journey in the world of web development. While I've enjoyed working on the front-end, I'm determined to expand my horizons and embark on a path to becoming a Full Stack Developer. My ultimate career goal is to master both front-end and back-end technologies to build comprehensive and robust web applications.

This portfolio is a showcase of my current skills and projects, but it's also a testament to my commitment to learning and growth. Feel free to explore my journey as I work towards becoming a Full Stack Developer.
